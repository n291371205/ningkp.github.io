## Biography
My name is Kun-Peng Ning (宁鲲鹏). Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a M.S. student in the [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://cs.nuaa.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://www.nuaa.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Sheng-Jun Huang](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/huangsj/). Before that, I have finished my undergraduate study at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and received my B.E. degree in July 2019. Moreover, I was a research intern in **Tencent AI Lab** for a half year. And now, I am a research intern in **Tencent ARC Lab**.

My research interests include machine learning and data mining. Specifically I am working on **active learning** and **reinforcement learning**.
