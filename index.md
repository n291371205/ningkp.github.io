## Biography
My name is Kun-Peng Ning (宁鲲鹏). Welcome to my homepage!

I got my B.E. and M.S. degrees in computer science from [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://www.nuaa.edu.cn/) in 2019 and 2022, respectively, advised by Prof. [Sheng-Jun Huang](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/huangsj/). Moreover, I was a research intern in **Tencent AI Lab** and **Tencent ARC Lab** for half a year respectively. My research interests include machine learning and data mining. Specifically I am working on **active learning** and **reinforcement learning**.
